This is my submission for Assignment6.

This submission contains the following programs:

objstacktest
    -Usage
        ./objstacktest
    -Purpose
        Tests custom stack implementation

objqueuetest
    -Usage
        ./objqueuetest
    -Purpose
        Tests custom queue implementaion (objqueue)

treetest
    -Usage
        ./treetest
    -Purpose
        Tests custom tree class (tree.cpp and Tnode.cpp)

treetestrand
    -Usage
        ./treetestrand
    -Purpose
        Tests custom tree class (tree.cpp and Tnode.cpp). Adds multiple random strings and then prints        them sorted in ascending order. Program then frees the tree when finished.

I made the following design choice:

1. Duplicate strings added to the tree are ignored.
